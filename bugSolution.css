To solve this, you could either:

1. **Increase the Specificity:** Make the intended style more specific by adding more selectors to it. For example, instead of `p { color: blue; }`, you could use `#myParagraph p { color: blue; }` to target a paragraph within a specific element with an ID of 'myParagraph'.

2. **Use !important:**  (Generally discouraged due to maintainability issues)  You can use `!important` to force a particular style rule, but this is usually a last resort and makes CSS less maintainable.

3. **Re-order Styles:**  The order in which stylesheets are linked (if using multiple) can affect which rules take precedence. Check the order and move the more specific stylesheet closer to the end of the `<head>` section.

4. **CSS Preprocessor variables and mixins:** Using variables and mixins in CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less can improve maintainability and reduce conflicting styles.
